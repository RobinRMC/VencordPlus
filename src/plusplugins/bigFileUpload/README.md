# Big File Upload
This is a Vencord plugin that allows you to circumvent Discord's file upload size limit by uploading files to services such as Gofile, Catbox, Litterbox or a custom one of your choice that allows you to import ShareX config files, and then automatically putting the link to the file into your chatbox.

This is essentially a quick way to upload big files to Discord, without having Nitro.

To upload a big file, click the `Upload a Big File` button (located under the regular upload button) or use the `/fileupload` command.
