<details>
<summary>Using Vencord(+) violates Discord's terms of service</summary>

Client modifications are against Discord’s Terms of Service.

However, Discord is pretty indifferent about them and there are no known cases of users getting banned for using client mods! So you should generally be fine as long as you don’t use any plugins that implement abusive behaviour. You should know what a plugin does and configure it properly before using it.

Regardless, if your account is very important to you and it getting disabled would be a disaster for you, you should probably not use any client mods (not exclusive to Vencord+ or Vencord), just to be safe.

Additionally, make sure not to send screenshots and messages that expose that you are using a client mod.
